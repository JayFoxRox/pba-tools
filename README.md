This is a set of tools to operate on The Pinball Arcade (PBA) files.
PBA is a video-game developed by [FarSight Studios](http://farsightstudios.com/).

Most of the tools in this repository convert to [JSON](http://json.org), TGA or OBJ/MTL.

This tool is not able to *create* any kind of PBA files yet!
It merely loads / converts PBA files to more usable file formats at the moment.
